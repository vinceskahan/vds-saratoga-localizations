This is a tree of my patches to the weewx-wd-based saratoga skin.

This assumes you've installed Saratoga, installed my WE 'plugin',
and also installed my weewx-wd-related patches so the two work
correctly together with the vanilla upstream location etc.

To install, patch each file individually.

You almost certainly do 'not' want to run this on your site,
but I posted it here to (a) serve as an example of typical edits
and (b) make sure that I didn't lose all this hard work
