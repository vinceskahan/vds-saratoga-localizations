 	<h3>About This City</h3>

+Federal Way began in the late 1800s as a logging settlement. By the 1920s, Federal Highway 99 was complete, linking the community to the economic centers of Seattle and Tacoma, and suggesting a name for the young community. The name Federal Way was first used in 1929 when five existing schools consolidated operations into School District #210 and planned construction of Federal Way High School next to Highway 99. 
+</dd>
+<p>
+<dd>
+By the end of the 1950s, the community featured a number of housing areas and a 10-block commercial district with a shopping center and family-oriented theme park. During the 1960s, residential development continued, providing homes to Boeing engineers and Weyerhaeuser executives. Retail growth followed, including the construction of SeaTac Mall (now The Commons at Federal Way) in the mid-1970s.

+<p>
+<em>Rapid Growth</em>
+<dl>
+<dd>
+Rapid retail and residential growth created significant changes in the community during the 1970s and 1980s. Desiring controlled, quality growth and community identity, Federal Way citizens organized to form what was then Washington's sixth largest city, incorporating in February of 1990. In November 2010 Federal Way citizens decided to change from a council-manager form of government to a mayor-council form. 
+</dd>
+<p>
+<dd>
+Today, the Federal Way community is residential and commercial with a population employed locally and in neighboring cities such as Sea Tac, Kent, Tacoma, Bellevue and Seattle. An estimated 22,485 people are employed within the city limits. 
+</dd>
+</dl>
+<p>
+<em>Since Incorporation</em>
+<dl>
+<dd>
+In the years since incorporation, Federal Way has fostered quality commercial and residential growth, and enhanced the quality of life for its residents with infrastructure improvements, diverse recreational opportunities and high-quality parks. The city's Comprehensive Plan looks to Federal Way's future and includes plans for a vibrant City Center, with mixed-use commercial and residential development in the downtown business area and access to public transportation.

-	<p>Springfield was founded in 1796 by settlers who were trying to find a passage to Maryland after mis-interpreting a passage in the Bible. In its early days, the city was the target of many Indian raids, and to this day many forts and trading posts remain (including Fort Springfield and Fort Sensible).</p>
-
-	<p>The founder of Springfield was pioneer Jebediah Springfield, widely celebrated in the town as a brave and proud American hero. The town motto "a noble spirit embiggens the smallest man" is attributed to Jebediah.</p>
-
-	<p>In the mid-20th century, the city reached perhaps the pinnacle of its success when it became the home of the Aquacar, a car which could be driven in water like a boat. At this point, the city's streets were literally paved with gold. But unfortunately, as related in the Are We There Yet? Guide to Springfield, this fortune imploded when it was discovered that the Aquacar was prone to spontaneous explosion after 10,000 miles and/or knots. The town has never really recovered from this tragedy (the gold was reportedly shipped to the Sultan of Brunei to encase one of his many elephant herds), but some heavy industry remains in the town, including factories for Ah! Fudge chocolate, Southern Cracker, fireworks, candy, and boxes, as well as a steel mill.</p>
